This program creates a finite state machine of a keypad lock that accepts 
{0,9} and unlocks with code <147258> It runs program-generated 'codes' to 
test fsm and also runs user-generated keypad code. The character <#> will
cause a return to the start state and state machine will reach end state
when correct code is provided.
